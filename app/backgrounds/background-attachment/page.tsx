                Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me.
                Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about

                at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and
                wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?

                to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that
                turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You
                and your good-time buddies.
